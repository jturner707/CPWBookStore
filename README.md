## Getting Started

### Installing TypeScript
- Download and install [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en)
- I recommend the LTS version of Node.js.
- In the command line run 'npm install -g typescript'
- It is case sensitive.

### Compiling TypeScript
To compile the TypeScript files with the watch option, 
run the following command: `tsc --watch` .  Using the watch 
options, only requires us to compile once each time the 
project is opened.
